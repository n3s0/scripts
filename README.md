# scripts

Disclaimer: These are scripts that I use from time to time to aid me in my
workflow. This may not benefit you. I ask that you use caution when using them
as these may have undesired effects on your environment. Please read the script
before you run it and don't run unless you're certain that it will work for you.
Testing is key in this case.

Repository of scripts that I use from time to time or don't want to forget. I'll 
provide a description of what they do and how to use them in their respective 
README.

I will add more as time goes on. This is just to get this out there and
available to me.
